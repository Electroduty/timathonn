<h3>About the maker of Explore(Me-Gaurav Chandrashekar):

So... I am a 12 year old boy who is currently into programming with python and C#. I am much more proficient with python tho... 
I was scrolling thru youtube when I found tim's timathon video and I absolutely loved it! So here i am acctually oarticipating in the timathon!</p>

<h3>About the app:</h3>

<p>This is an app called Explore(not very good at naming ._.). There are a lot of things you can do with explore. Such as... Search for places around you(restaurants,
Pharmacies, etc...) and even browse for videos (just like youtube!), search for videos or maybe even upload one! So Tim, if you loking at my repository... Please
please post a video(I would love that!). By the way, anybody can post videos! But not too much. The server will cause a lot of lag...</p>
