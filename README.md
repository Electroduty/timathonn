<h3>About the maker of Explore(Me-Gaurav Chandrashekar):</h3>
<p>So... I am a 12 year old boy who is currently into programming with python and C#. I am much more proficient with python though... 
I was scrolling through youtube when I found Tim's Timathon video and I absolutely loved it! So here I am, acctually participating in the timathon!</p>

<h3>About the app:</h3>

  
<p>This is an app called Explore(not very good at naming ._.). There are a lot of things you can do with explore. Such as... Search for places around you(restaurants,Pharmacies, etc...) with EPlaces.
  And also be sure to give me a rating on the website for a surprise!

and even browse for videos (just like youtube!), search for videos or maybe even upload one with <img src="static/images/logo.png" alt="EStreams icon" width="200px"> So Tim, if you loking at my repository... Please
please post a video(I would love that!). By the way, anybody can post videos! But not too much. The server will cause a lot of lag...</p>
